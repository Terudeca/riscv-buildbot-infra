riscv-buildbot-infra: The RISC-V buildbot infastructure

This repository contains a buildbot configuration file that runs a
number of RISC-V projects.  The general idea here is to keep
everything in one place so it's easier for people to duplicate this
setup on their own machines, when running the code they care about.
